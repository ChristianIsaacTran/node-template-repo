# node-template-repo
This is a template repository for myself with the sole purpose of creating future repositories that use webpack and npm easier.

-- Includes a .gitignore to ignore the node_modules and the dist file since the dist folder is going to be our bundled website code and node_modules is tracked by package.json and can be reinstalled based on package.json dependencies.
